Displays possible usage of items on the blackmarket sell screen. 
No more wondering whether you still need Advent Trooper Corpses. 

Data is gathered dynamically, so modded items, costs etc should show up as well.
This is compatible with Long War 2 and all the stuff it adds. Lists might get
a bit long for more common resources.

Only shows items of your current research level.
This can be configured using the [url=http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=667104300]Mod Config Menu[/url] mod.
If you don't want to use that and instead change this the old fashioned way,
run the game at least once, then edit:
 Documents\My Games\XCOM2\XComGame\Config\XComBlackmarketUsage_Settings.ini

Thanks to Robojumper for fixing some performance issues and
BlueRaja for adding Mod Config Menu Support.
